# GSM-based-Intruder-Alert-System
A System designed to send an SMS to a particular number as “Intruder Alert” or any predefined message,when the door of a room is opened forcefully  with the help of IR Sensors,GSM Module(simcom 900A Module) and Microcontroller.
The system is made on Atmega16 but u can use any Atmega series microcontroller.It uses SIMCOM 900A as a GSM module which connects through a SIM(Subscriber Identification module).
I have included the code on Atmel Studio that is common IDE for all Atmel microcontroller,the design on Proteus and the full description of the project.
Software used:
1.Atmel Studio 6
2.Proteus
3.Hercules
The full datasheet of Atmega16,SIMCOM 900A will also be included.Hercules is a software that is used to serially communicate with GSM module as GSM used serial communication.
